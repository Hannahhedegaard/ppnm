Task A: Linear spline - Linear interpolation.
gsl_vectors are used in this exercise.
The linear interpolation function is implemented in linterp.c.
Integration of the linear spline is implemented in linterp_integ.c.
The plot in fig-linterp-pyxplot.png shows the original points, the linear interpolation,
the	linear interpolation integration, and the two GSL routines to comparison.

Task B: Quadratic spline.
Quadratic spline is implemented in quad.c
The derivaive and integral are implemented in quad_diff.c and quad_integ.c.
The plot in fig-quadterp-pyxplot.png shows original points, and the quadratic interpolation, integration and differential.

Task C: Cubic spline.
Quadratic spline is implemented in cubic.c.
The derivaive and integral are implemented in cubic_diff.c and cubic_integ.c.
The plot in fig-cubicterp-pyxplot.png shows the original points, the cubic interpolation, integration and differential,
together with the GSL routines for comparison.
All data for linear, quadratic and cubic spline is put into linterp.dat.
