Task A
The experimental data are plotted with errorbars and the best fit.
The half-life time is calculated as: log(2)/λ, where λ is the slope from the fit.
Half-life time = 4.04452 days
Half-life time (today) = 3.6319 days

Task B
Calculating the uncertainties.
The uncertainty is calculated from propagation of error: log(2)/λ^2 * σ_λ
Uncertainty in half-life time = 0.0834378 days
Half-life time uncertainty (today) = 0.0023 days
The modern uncertainty is a factor of 10 smaller than the one obtained in 1902.
This is expected as modern experiments are much more accurate.

Task C
Two extra fits are plottet, where the fit coefficients are changed by δc.
