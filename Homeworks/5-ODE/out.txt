Task A: Embedded Runge-Kutta ODE integrator
The Runge-Kutta stepper with XY=12 is implemented in functions.c.
Furthermore, an adaptive-step-size driver routine is implemented in functions.c.
The routines are checked with the example: u''=-u.
As another example, the SIR model of epidemic development is considered.

Task B: Store the path.
The path from the uprime example is written in the file uprime.txt and plotted in uprime.pyxplot.png.
The path from the SIR example is written into SIR.txt and plotted in SIR.pyxplot.png.

Task C: Newtonian gravitational three-body problem.
The routines are now used on Newtonian gravitational three-body problem.
The path is written in Newton.txt and plotted in Newton.pyxplot.png.
Furthermore, figure 8 is reproduced from this solution and is plotted in Figure8_Newton.pyxplot.png.
