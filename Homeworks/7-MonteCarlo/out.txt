Task A and B: Plain and quasi-random Monte Carlo integration.
The two functions are implemented in functions.c.
The functions are checked by calculating:
Integral of sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 with plain MC        = 0.6666861893, error = 0.0007442960341
Integral of sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 with quasi-random MC = 0.6666458624, error = 4.124894534e-05
Exact result: 0.6666666667
Comparison of the errors for the two methods are shown in Figure 1.

The functions are further tested by calculating the integral given in Task A.
Integral of integral in task A with plain MC        = 1.394384497, error = 0.02572123318
Integral of integral in task A with quasi-random MC = 1.382293352, error = 0.0002085638922
Exact result: 1.3932039296856768591842462603255
Comparison of the errors for the two methods are shown in Figure 2.

Comment: the two figures show, that the errors are smaller for the quasi-random method.
The errors for the integral from task A with the plain method are widely distributed, and a fit is hard to make.
Nevertheless, the errors are clearly smaller for the quasi-random method.
