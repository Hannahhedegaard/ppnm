Akima sub-spline.
The Akima sub-spline is implemented in functions.c.
The implementation is now tested on two different set of data-points.
---------------------------------------------------
Dataset 1: see input1.dat for original data-points.
This will lead to a replication of Figure 1.2 from the book.

Length of dataset 1: 6
x-values:    y-values:
    -3.5           -1
    -2.1           -1
    -0.6           -1
     0.8            1
     2.1            1
     3.6            1

The Akima sub-spline is calculated, see results in data1.txt.
Furthermore, the cubic spline is calculated, results also in data1.txt.
The results are shown in Figure1.pyxplot.png, and as this is a replication of Figure 1.2 in the book,
the two figures can be compared.

Comment: the two figures are very similar - and it is clear that the Akima sub-spline
wiggels less than the cubic spline, as expected.
---------------------------------------------------
Dataset 2: see input2.dat for original data-points.
This data-set is made to show how the Akima sub-spline interpolates,
when one of the data-points lies away from the others.

Length of dataset 2: 10
x-values:    y-values:
       1            2
       2          2.1
       3            2
       4            5
       5            2
       6          1.9
       7          1.8
       8          1.9
       9          2.2
      10          1.5

The Akima sub-spline is calculated, see results in data2.txt.
Furthermore, the cubic spline is calculated, results also in data2.txt.
The results are shown in Figure2.pyxplot.png.

Comment: It is shown in the figure, that the Akima sub-spline makes a smooth interpolation
through the data-points, even though there is an outlier. The cubic spline, on the other hand,
shows the typical wiggels.
